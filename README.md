This is just a repository containing my first step into computer programming. These scripts, written in Ruby, served the purpose of interacting with the API of an application (Datavyu) used for research in the social sciences.
They perform tasks such as aggregating data, writing data to .csv files, calculating various quantities of interest, and manipulating files.
I wrote these as a research assistant at the Koegel Autism Center at UCSB - this led to a publication in which I was credited as third author:

(I do not take any credit for any aspect of the Datavyu application)
