This is just a repository containing my first experience with real world programming. These scripts, written in Ruby, served the purpose of mainly extracting, transforming and analyzing input data from an application (Datavyu) used for research in the social sciences.
They perform tasks such as aggregating data, writing data to .csv files, calculating various quantities of interest, and manipulating files, etc.
This work was in support of a publication in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders:
